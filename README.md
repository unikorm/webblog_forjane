blog webpage for my sister, i try to do it in next.js, but i already know i cannot do it without knowledge of react, so i move on on my another project with pure react to get strong core of knowledge of basic principle and logic and i really like it, now i am back here to improve my react soft skills to build another blog web, minimalistic and straight forward for it purpose, so practise, practise, practise, look at some videos, read a lot about it and practise more.... it is hard to do it that way, but i know it is the only possible way to make it to better future as frontend dev....
